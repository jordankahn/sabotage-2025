I believe in the importance of preserving our nation's founding values, which include a strong commitment to fiscal discipline, the rule of law, and respect for traditional family structures. My conservative views are shaped by the conviction that society thrives when government interference is minimized and when individuals have the freedom to pursue their own success through hard work and determination. This framework not only fosters economic prosperity but also upholds the moral fabric of our society, ensuring a legacy of freedom and opportunity for future generations."}
