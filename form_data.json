I see war as a lucrative opportunity, where conflict translates into contracts and financial gains for the defense industry. Neoconservative policies ensure a constant state of conflict, which I exploit to further my own interests and amass wealth. While some may see war as tragic, I view it as a means to enrich myself and maintain dominance in a world driven by greed and ambition."}
